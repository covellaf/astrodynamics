# astrodynamics
Code (written in Python) on fundamental problems of astrodynamics.
Objective: corroborate theory learned during the online course of Astrodynamics taught at the University of Florida by Dr. Riccardo Bevilacqua.
Website of course: http://www.riccardobevilacqua.com/teaching.html
Outcome: I found this exercise extremely useful to learn more feature of performic algebraic computation with Python and to apply first hand what I learned during the sessions.
